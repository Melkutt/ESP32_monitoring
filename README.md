# ESP32_monitoring

<h2> Still a Î±-relese </h2>

2023-11-02 Updated with some new features.

Monitoring voltage, temperature and humidity and present it on a web server. 
This is built with a <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qt-py-esp32-s3/pinouts">Adafruit ESP32 QT</a> board and a DHT11 sensor, but this code will almost certainly work in many others MCU's.
It's writen in Arduino IDE.

It's based on <a href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-dht11-dht22-temperature-humidity-web-server-arduino-ide/">Rui Santos</a> tutorial on ESP32 web server
with DHT11 sensor.

I haved to add <code>size_t mp_task_heap_size = heap_caps_get_largest_free_block(MALLOC_CAP_8BIT) - 32*1024</code> to make it work with the S2 chip.


More info is coming!
